Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And no regime can buy or sell me

I've been dreaming of a time when
To be English is not to be baneful
To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful, racist or partial

Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And I will die with both of my hands untied

I've been dreaming of a time when
The English are sick to death of Labour and Tories
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell
And denounce this royal line that still salute him
And will salute him forever
